  ## Tetrlang code format (Read more at [README](<https://github.com/murataharu0803/tetrlang#tetrlang-code-format>))
  The Tetrlang code is composed of three parts:
  `board:order:operations`
  ### board (optional)
  - `board` consists of rows from bottom to top, separated by commas.
  - Indicate the garbage holes with column numbers 0 to 9
  ### order (optional)
  - Default available pieces are `I`, `J`, `L`, `O`, `S`, `T`, `Z`.
  - Specify initial hold piece by prepending the piece and `|` (pipe).
  ### operations
  `operations` is a sequence of operations to perform on the board.
  - Lock (space): `;`
  - Hold (shift): `|` (only when order is provided)
  - Rotation: `r` (clockwise), `z` (counterclockwise), `a` (180 flip)
  - Movement: `<` (left), `>` (right), `[` (left to side), `]` (right to side)
  - Drop: `.` (fall down one step), `_` (soft drop to bottom)
  - If order was not provided, the first operation must be a piece.
  ## Examples
  - no order provided: `2,,,,-1,-2,,,-3::Jr[;Tr[;S[r_r;Z[_r;`
  - order provided:  `2,,,,-1,-2,,,-3:S|JTLZ:r[;r[;|[r_r;[_r;`
  - Perfect Clear Opening: `:I|TSZILJOTSZ:r[;_[;[;];r>>;z];]<;z>;;z_z<;`
